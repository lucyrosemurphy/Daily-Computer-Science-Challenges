# Daily-Computer-Science-Challenges
Hello There World! Hello people of the intertoobs. 
Glad you stumbled upon my page. 
My goal is to do some simple cs problems every day, and document them here. 
I will of course miss days, but hopefully posting them will help motivate me.
If I work on a separate CS project on a specific day I will note that instead of doing a problem.
Wish me luck! 
You can do them along with me if you would like!
I will make a comment before I spoil any solutions.
Languages may include (but are not limited to): C++, Python, Netlogo, Java 

Have fun!
